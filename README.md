🚗 Car Price Prediction

A Machine Learning project that predicts car selling prices based on mileage and age using the Random Forest Regression algorithm. This model demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be leveraged for real-world price estimation problems in the automotive sector.

📘 Overview

The Car Price Prediction project is designed to estimate the resale value of a car using its key attributes such as mileage (driven kilometers) and age (years since manufacturing).

By analyzing the dataset carprices.csv, the project implements a Random Forest Regression model that learns patterns and relationships between features and selling prices. The model achieves an impressive R² score of over 90%, indicating high predictive accuracy and generalization capability.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas – Data manipulation and cleaning

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Model building and evaluation

🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

Data Collection & Preprocessing

Loaded and cleaned the dataset (carprices.csv).

Handled missing values and outliers for better model performance.

Encoded categorical variables if required.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized relationships between car mileage, age, and selling price.

Identified correlations and feature importance through plots.

Model Training

Used Random Forest Regression due to its robustness and non-linear prediction capabilities.

Split data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80–20 ratio).

Trained the model using grid search for optimal hyperparameters.

Model Evaluation

Evaluated model performance using R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Achieved 90%+ R² score, ensuring strong predictive accuracy.

Prediction

Given a car’s mileage and age, the model predicts its expected selling price.

📊 Features

✅ Cleaned and processed dataset for accurate results
✅ Data visualization: Mileage vs. Price trends
✅ Trained and tested Random Forest Regression model
✅ Achieved high accuracy (90%+ R²)
✅ Easy-to-extend pipeline for adding more features like brand, fuel type, or transmission

🔍 Example Visualization

Visual insights showing the relationship between mileage and price help understand the depreciation trend and justify model predictions.
